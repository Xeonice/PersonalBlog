          I do work as a web developer at Teamleader right now but I also work
          on other side projects that are not only development related. If you
          want to see my development related things, I recommend that you visit

          The side project I am working on right now is to provide a platform
          for people that want to learn my mother language Tamil.

          In a first step, I'm working on a small book that I will use as the
          foundation to build an app and a community around learning the
          language Tamil and also learning about the Tamil culture and history.

          Talks

        <p>
          In January 2019, I gave my first tech-related talk. Since it was an
          exciting experience, I will hopefully fill up this list with a few
          more talks, not only about tech-related stuff but also about society
          related things as I did a few times in the past already.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want me to give a talk at your meetup, conference or even
          private events, feel free to message me.
