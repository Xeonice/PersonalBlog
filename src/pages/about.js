      I’m Rathes Sachchithananthan, a web developer with not only interests in
      engineering but also product development & design, user & customer
      experience and most importantly in languages and cultures.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started working as a web designer and web developer at very young ages.
      At the age of 14, I earned my first money as a web designer creating
      custom MySpace layouts and in 2008, at the age of 16, I founded my first
      own company for web design and development. Since then I have worked with
      several clients doing quite a wide range of tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more than 10 years I have been working as a web developer doing
      solving problems as a back-end engineer using languages such as PHP,
      Python or Node.js but also as a front-end developer working with HTML/CSS
      and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, my real passion is not for software and development. I’m more
      into solving problems for people, make their lives easier and connect them
      with each other. Together with that, I’m passionate about learning new
      languages and cultures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays, I work as a web developer at Teamleader in Ghent, Belgium
      building things using PHP in the back-end and React in the front-end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from that, I spent most of my time working smaller side projects at
      Aheenam. Right now I’m working on providing a platform for people to learn
      my mother language Tamil.
